# HelloScala

This project contains a bunch of little projects that I am doing just to learn
about the Scala programming language

## Boggle

I wrote more about my Boggle code [here](http://bplawler.tumblr.com/post/10569631567/scala-diversion-a-small-project).  This little bit of code is basically
an overly simplified implementation of the Boggle word game.  I did this just
to see if I could pick Scala back up after not coding anything in it for a few
weeks.

## Skyline

The [skyline problem](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1066234/the-skyline-problem)
was just a fun little programming problem that I heard about and decided to 
try out in Scala.  I used this problem as an exercise to learn more about a
concept called "[folding](http://oldfashionedsoftware.com/2009/07/10/scala-code-review-foldleft-and-foldright/)".
